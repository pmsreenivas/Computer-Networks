c. This Project invloves the communication between 5 different entities, each with their own roles. The client inputs data about various links, this is relayed to server A via the AWS server. The client also asks to compute the delay for a particular link with some additional parameters, this request is relayed via the AWS to server A which checks whether the link exists. If so server B computes the values and relays the answers to the client via the AWS. The monitor keeps recording all sorts of transactions that take place.

d. client.c - code for the client
   monitor.c - code for the monitor
   aws.c - code for the aws server
   serverA.c - code for the Backend server A
   serverB.c - code for the Backend server B
   header.h - common header file for all code files
   makefile - code that creates the executables and helps in running each code
   README - description of the project

e. Messages between the client and the AWS server and the monitor and the AWS server are exchanged using TCP. Messages between the Backend server A and the AWS and the Backend server B and the AWS are exchanged using UDP.

g. none

h. Code from Beej's tutorial have been used in all code files. They have been marked using inline comments.
